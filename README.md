## Welcome to the CyanoCounter! 

This counter is a user-friendly tool designed to assist community scientists in counting cyanobacteria from water samples for lake monitoring. 

### To use the counter:
**1.** Open the [CyanoCounter page](https://jvthaney.github.io/cyanocounter/).

**2.** First, enter your **name**, **date** of sample collection, **time** of collection, general **location** on the lake, **coordinates** (lat/lon).

**3.** Next, enter the **volume** of your net sample (measured in the graduated cylinder). You can leave the default values for **depth**, **net diameter**, and **rows** **counted**, _**unless**_ you sampled a different depth, used a non-LSPA plankton net, or counted more or less than 5 rows on the slide. 
- The # rows is used to esimate the proportion of the slide you have counted (20 rows total)
- The sample volume is used in combination with a volume of 1 mL for the Sedgewick Rafter cell to estimate the number of cells/colonies per sample
- The net ring size and depth inputs are used to calculate the volume of lake water sampled

**4.** Enter any additional notes that might be helpful (e.g., notes about location, weather conditions, visible bloom etc.)

**5.** Click **"Submit Info"** to log this information. You can go back and change these answers at any time, just make sure you click Submit Info again to log any changes you make.

**4.** Now you're ready to count. As you move across your slide, use the counters to keep track of the number of each type of cyanobacteria you encounter. Remember to count all cells/colonies from **5 random rows** on the slide. 
- Use the **+** button to increase the number, and the **-** button to decrease the count
- The total number of each cyanobacteria counted is displayed at the bottom of each colored box
- If you need to reset the counters at any time, just click the "**Reset counters**" button

**5.** When you are finished counting 5 rows, click "**Export data**" to download these data to the computer.
- The downloaded file (.csv) will contain the # of each cyanboacteria and the information you provided at the top of the page
- The filename will automatically be set as your name and the date
- A real-time preview of the count data is always shown beneath the counters (bottom of page)
