## Welcome to the CyanoCounter! 

This counter is a user-friendly tool designed to assist community scientists in counting cyanobacteria from water samples for lake monitoring purposes on Lake Sunapee, NH. 

### To use the counter:
**1.** Open the [CyanoCounter page](https://jvthaney.github.io/cyanocounter/).

**2.** Enter your name, date of sample collection, time of collection, general location on the lake, and coordinates (lat/lon).

**3.** Click the **"Submit Info"** button** to save this information.

**4.** Now you're ready to count. As you move across your slide, use the counters to keep track of the number of each type of cyanobacteria you encounter. Remember to count all cells/colonies from **5 random rows** on the slide. 
- Use the **+** button to increase the number, and the **-** button to decrease the count
- The total number of each cyanobacteria counted is displayed at the bottom of each colored box
- If you need to reset the counters at any time, just click the "**Reset counters**" button

**5.** When you are finished counting 5 rows, click "**Export data**" to download these data to the computer.
- The downloaded file (.csv) will contain the # of each cyanboacteria and the information you provided at the top of the page
- The filename will automatically be set as your name and the date
- A real-time preview of the count data is always shown beneath the counters (bottom of page)
