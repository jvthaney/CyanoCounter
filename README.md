## Welcome to the CyanoCounter, PlanktonCounter, and TaxonCounter! 

These counters are user-friendly tools designed for enumerating taxa in aquatic (CyanoCounter and PlanktonCounter) or terrestrial (TaxonCounter) environments. 

### Quick guide to differences:
**CyanoCounter**
- For cyanobacteria, specifically (common taxa are preset on the counters, with the option to change names and/or add more taxa)
- Calculates #cells/colonies per liter lake water based on user inputs of depth, plankton net ring size, and volume of sample

**PlanktonCounter**
- For any taxa from a plankton tow (user adds names to all counters, with the option to add more taxa)
- Calculates #cells/colonies per liter lake water based on user inputs of depth, plankton net ring size, and volume of sample

**TaxonCounter**
- General counters for any aquatic or terrestrial taxa (user adds names to all counters, with the option to add more taxa)
- Calculates # counted/square meter based on user inputs 

## To use the counters:

**1.** Open the [CyanoCounter page](https://jvthaney.github.io/cyanocounter/).

**2.** If you want a different counter, navigate click the **"More counters"** button at the top of the page.

**3.** First, enter your **name**, **date** of sample collection, **time** of collection, general **location** on the lake, **coordinates** (lat/lon).

<ins>**4a.** For the CyanoCounter and PlanktonCounter</ins>, enter the **volume** of your net sample (measured in the graduated cylinder). You can leave the default values for **depth**, **net diameter**, and **rows** **counted**, _**unless**_ you sampled a different depth, used a non-LSPA plankton net, or counted more or less than 5 rows on the slide. 
- The # rows is used to esimate the proportion of the slide you have counted
- The sample volume is used in combination with a volume of 1 mL for the Sedgewick Rafter cell to estimate the number of cells/colonies per sample
- The net ring size and depth inputs are used to calculate the volume of lake water sampled

<ins>**4b.** For the TaxonCounter</ins>, enter the **area** sampled, if applicable.

**5.** Enter any additional **notes** that might be helpful (e.g., notes about location, weather conditions, visible bloom, other taxa observed, etc.)

**6.** Click **"Submit Info"** to log this information. You can go back and change these answers at any time, just make sure you click Submit Info again to log any changes you make.

**7.** Now you're ready to count. As you move across your slide, use the counters to keep track of the number of each type of cyanobacteria you encounter. Remember to count all cells/colonies from 5 random rows on the slide. 
- Use the **+** button to increase the count and the **-** button to decrease it
- The total number of each cyanobacteria counted is displayed at the bottom of each colored box
- If you need to reset the counters at any time, click the "**Reset counters**" button (only do this if you're sure you want to start over)

**8.** When you are finished counting 5 rows, click "**Export data**" to download these data to the computer.
- The downloaded file (.csv) will contain the # of each cyanboacteria and the information you provided at the top of the page
- The filename will automatically be set as your name and the date
- A real-time preview of the count data is always shown beneath the counters (bottom of page)
